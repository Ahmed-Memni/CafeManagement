# Cafe Management App

This JavaFX project is an application designed to manage various aspects of a café business. It enables the efficient handling of data related to chefs, servers, stock inventory, suppliers, and customers. The app allows users to input, update, and retrieve information for each category, ensuring smooth operations and accurate tracking of key business components. By providing a central platform for managing these critical areas, the application helps streamline daily tasks, improve organization, and facilitate better decision-making for café management.
